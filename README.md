# machma10

Machma10 is a Telegram bot that allows a group to track exercises and see where everyone is at
with their reps.

## Getting started

1. To deploy Machma10, you first need to have a Telegram Bot API token. Talk to the
   [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) to create a new bot. Write that token into a file
   called `api_token.txt`

2. Install the bot by running `poetry install`.

3. Run the bot with `python3 -m machma.bot`
